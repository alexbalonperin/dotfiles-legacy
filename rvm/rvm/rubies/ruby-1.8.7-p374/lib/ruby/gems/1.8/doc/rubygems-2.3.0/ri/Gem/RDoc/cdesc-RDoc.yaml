- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Gem::RDoc provides methods to generate RDoc and ri data for installed gems. It works for RDoc 1.0.1 (in Ruby 1.8) up to RDoc 3.6.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This implementation is considered obsolete. The RDoc project is the appropriate location to find this functionality. This file provides the hooks to load RDoc generation code from the &quot;rdoc&quot; gem and a fallback in case the installed version of RDoc does not have them.
