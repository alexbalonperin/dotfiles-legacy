  body: The platform this gem runs on.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is usually Gem::Platform::RUBY or Gem::Platform::CURRENT.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Most gems contain pure Ruby code; they should simply leave the default value in place. Some gems contain C (or other) code to be compiled into a Ruby &quot;extension&quot;. The should leave the default value in place unless their code will only compile on a certain type of system. Some gems consist of pre-compiled code (&quot;binary gems&quot;). It's especially important that they set the platform attribute appropriately. A shortcut is to set the platform to Gem::Platform::CURRENT, which will cause the gem builder to set the platform to the appropriate value for the system on which the build is being performed.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If this attribute is set to a non-default value, it will be included in the filename of the gem when it is built such as: nokogiri-1.6.0-x86-mingw32.gem"

  body: "Usage:"
