  body: Draw a <tt>width</tt> x <tt>height</tt> image. The image is specified by calling one or more drawing methods on the RVG object. You can group the drawing method calls in the optional associated block. The <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> arguments have no meaning for the outermost RVG object. On nested RVG objects [<tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>] is the coordinate of the upper-left corner in the containing canvas on which the nested RVG object is placed.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Drawing occurs on a <tt>canvas</tt> created by the #draw method. By default the canvas is transparent. You can specify a different canvas with the #background_fill= or #background_image= methods."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: RVG objects are <em>containers</em>. That is, styles and transforms defined on the object are used by contained objects such as shapes, text, and groups unless overridden by an inner container or the object itself.
