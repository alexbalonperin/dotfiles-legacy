= How to contribute

Community involvement is essential to RubyGems. We want to keep it easy as
possible to contribute changes. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow to reduce the time it takes to get changes merged in.

== Guidelines

1. New features should be coupled with tests.

2. Ensure that your code blends well with ours (eg, no trailing whitespace,
   match indentation and coding style).

3. Don't modify the history file or version number.

4. If you have any questions, just ask on IRC in #rubygems on Freenode or file
   an issue here: http://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues
