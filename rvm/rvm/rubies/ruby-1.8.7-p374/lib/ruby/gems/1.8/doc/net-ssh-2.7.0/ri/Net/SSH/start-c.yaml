- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The standard means of starting a new SSH connection. When used with a block, the connection will be closed when the block terminates, otherwise the connection will just be returned. The yielded (or returned) value will be an instance of Net::SSH::Connection::Session (q.v.). (See also Net::SSH::Connection::Channel and Net::SSH::Service::Forward.)
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Net::SSH.start(&quot;host&quot;, &quot;user&quot;) do |ssh|\n    ssh.exec! &quot;cp /some/file /another/location&quot;\n    hostname = ssh.exec!(&quot;hostname&quot;)\n\n    ssh.open_channel do |ch|\n      ch.exec &quot;sudo -p 'sudo password: ' ls&quot; do |ch, success|\n        abort &quot;could not execute sudo ls&quot; unless success\n\n        ch.on_data do |ch, data|\n          print data\n          if data =~ /sudo password: /\n            ch.send_data(&quot;password\\n&quot;)\n          end\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    ssh.loop\n  end\n"
