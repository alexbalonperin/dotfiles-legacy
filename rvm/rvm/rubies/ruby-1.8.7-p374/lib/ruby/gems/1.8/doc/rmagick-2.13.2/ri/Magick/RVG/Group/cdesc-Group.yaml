  body: Define a collection of shapes, text, etc. that can be reused. Group objects are <em>containers</em>. That is, styles and transforms defined on the group are used by contained objects such as shapes, text, and nested groups unless overridden by a nested container or the object itself. Groups can be reused with the RVG::UseConstructors#use method. Create groups within containers with the RVG::StructureConstructors#g method.
